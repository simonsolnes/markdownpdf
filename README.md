# markdown to pdf

This is a markdown to pdf converter for people who likes latex, but prefers to write in markdown. Write your text in markdown with titles, italic, bold and fixed-width. Whenever you need to make a fancy table or solve some next level equations; drop in some random latex code. No `$` escaping or anything like that.  *What about my latex header?* Include it when you run the script and it will be added to the top.

## Usage

```
./mdpdf.py [markdown document] [header file]
```
